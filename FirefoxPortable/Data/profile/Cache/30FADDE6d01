    <summary>All your social networks and instant messaging in one easy to use app - it&#39;s the #1 downloaded social networking add-on for Firefox. Get all your updates, update your status and share across Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and more - all at once! </summary>
    <description>*** Note: &lt;strong&gt;Yoono 7.1.0 is available on http://www.yoono.com &lt;/strong&gt;and includes brand new features such as support for multiple columns (dashboard view), other new features, and fixes for an incompatibility with the Tab Mix Plus add-on and a LinkedIn connection issue.  We hope to have this new version here in the Add-ons directory shortly.***Yoono is a powerful but easy to use sidebar for Firefox that helps you simplify your online social life by connecting you to Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, Flickr, Friendfeed, AIM, Yahoo IM and more...all in one place.  Yoono is also the easiest way to share stuff with all your social networks - share links, images and video from the page you&#39;re viewing across all your networks simultaneously.  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect to all your social networks&lt;/strong&gt; and never miss another status update from friends or family. You&#39;re connected wherever you are on the web.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update your status&lt;/strong&gt; across all your social networks at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All your IM services right in your browser sidebar&lt;/strong&gt; to easily chat while your surf the web - no more logging on to multiple services. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily share links, images, and video&lt;/strong&gt; from the page you are viewing with all your social networks at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover cool stuff&lt;/strong&gt; with the discovery widget that shows you related websites, images, videos and more as you browse.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOONO 7 ENHANCEMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;We are committed to giving you regular updates and improvements to Yoono - version 7.0.6 includes:  * LinkedIn support  * Support for Twitter lists (view in Yoono - more support coming soon)  * Improved performance - we&#39;ve rewritten a lot of the underlying code to make this the fastest and least resource intensive version of Yoono yet.  * Support for multiple account set up for Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and more.  * Profile selector that enables switching between user profiles (i.e. Twitter accounts) within browser tabs via a profile selector to the left of the URL bar.  * Groups - you can create Yoono groups and add users from any service (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) to your group, then filter your stream by group.    * Support for Facebook Inbox Messages and Notifications  * Support for Twitter&#39;s new retweet functionality  * Upload pics and more from your computer via our new partner yFrog (or other hosting services)  * Full text search of your updates stream so you can see what your friends are saying about a particular topic.  We&#39;re leveraging SQLite in HTML 5 to create a client side store of your updates and can store up to 25,000 of your recent updates.  * Connection improvements for Twitter, Facebook, and instant messaging services  * Spell check  * Improved pop up alert design &amp; configuration options  * New default skin &amp; UI design enhancements  * Simplified Read/Unread indicator (yellow background for new updates, fades away when read)  * Sign In/Out - you can now sign out of Yoono for more privacy.  If you are using as an unregistered user there is no password protection but you can disconnect from all services.  If you are a registered user you can password protect Yoono.  * Font size selection capability  * Bug fixes&lt;strong&gt;ALSO NEW FROM YOONO – UPDATED YOONO DESKTOP v1.6!&lt;/strong&gt;We have also updated our Yoono Desktop application with the features above – it&#39;s everything you love about Yoono as a standalone desktop client.

    <summary>Displays a country flag depicting the location of the current website&#39;s server and provides a multitude of tools such as site safety checks, whois, translation, similar sites, validation, URL shortening, and more...</summary>
    <description>Flagfox is an extension that displays a flag icon indicating the current webserver&#39;s physical location. Knowing where you&#39;re connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon&#39;s context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.Clicking the flag icon loads our default action, &lt;a href=&quot;http://geotool.flagfox.net/&quot;&gt;Geotool&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and &lt;abbr title=&quot;Internet Service Provider&quot;&gt;ISP&lt;/abbr&gt;. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:* Site safety and malware checks* Finding similar sites and reviews* Automatic translation to your language* &lt;abbr title=&quot;Search Engine Optimization&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/abbr&gt; and web development research* Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes* Whois and &lt;abbr title=&quot;Domain Name Service&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/abbr&gt; information* Page code validation* Quick URL shortening* Copying a server&#39;s &lt;abbr title=&quot;Internet Protocol&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/abbr&gt; address or other info* or you can create your own custom actions!Flagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://maxmind.com/&quot;&gt;Maxmind&lt;/a&gt;. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you&#39;re connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.</description>

    <description>The Weave Sync add-on lets you securely take your Firefox experience with you wherever you go. You can now surf the Web on your PC, get up and go, and have everything waiting for you on your phone: your history, open tabs, bookmarks, the Awesome Bar – just as you had left it. This add-on is a part of the Mozilla Labs Weave project which aims to integrate services more closely with the browser.Weave Sync currently supports continuous synchronization of your bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords and tabs. * Get the same results on the Smart Location Bar across your devices, so you can get to your favorite sites with just a few keystrokes* Get up and go. You can continue what you were doing: have the ability to open any tab you have open on all your devices.* Keep the same list of bookmarks on all your devices.* Typing is hard. Now, you can easily sign in to all your favorite sites using your saved passwords (this is especially handy on mobile phones, where it’s hard to type in complex passwords)* Do it all securely: Weave Sync encrypts user data before uploading it to Mozilla’s servers, so that only you can access your data</description>

    <summary>Reframe It is a commenting tool that lets people connect and share their thoughts online – right next to the topics they care about – anywhere on the web, without the permission of the site owner.  And the new Version 2.0 makes this easier than ever.</summary>
    <description>With Reframe It 2.0, you can connect with friends and strangers as you talk about news, sports, political issues, cool websites, funny pictures, where to find the best deal – anything you can find on the web.  Talk about sports teams on their web sites – highlight the scores, drag cool pics into the margin, then leave a public or private comment and share it with your friends through social networks like Twitter and Facebook, or share your comments with friends via e-mail.  Reply to each other to start threaded discussions; leave private notes just for yourself or for a few friends to see; check your feeds to keep track of what your friends and groups are saying – all in real time, whenever you want, wherever you are on the web.Using Reframe It is just like making comments on social networks like Facebook, except you can make comments anywhere on the web, and you can share your comments with anyone.  Just open the margin – you’ll see it at the right side of your browser window – whenever you want to make or read comments, then highlight, comment and share.  Reframe It supports sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, FriendFeed, Wordpress, RSS, HTML, e-mails and more.  Make friends, join groups, be a part of the conversation.With Reframe It, you can say what you want, where you want.  Forget about asking for forgiveness or permission.</description>
